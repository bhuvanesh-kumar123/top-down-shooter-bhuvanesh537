This is a fast-paced top-down shooter game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players control a spaceship, dodge incoming enemies, and shoot to survive as long as possible. With smooth controls, responsive design, and dynamic enemy movement, itâ€™s a fun project that showcases my skills in game logic and front-end web development.
